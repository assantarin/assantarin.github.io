  <h1>TRAVEL TO THE PAST OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL</h1>
  <p>Discover The Acient Beauty of Negros Occidental</p>
</div>

<div class="content1">
  <h1>Get to know about the rich history<br> and cultural heritage of Negros.</h1>
</div>

<div class="hometext">
  <h1>HISTORY</h1>
  <p>Negros Occidental occupies the northern and western parts of Negros Island, the fourth largest island in the Philippines. The province is bounded by the Visayan Sea on the north, Tanon Strait and Negros Oriental on the east, guimaras Strait on the northwest, Panay Gulf on the southwest and Sulu Sea on the south. </p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://bacolodcityproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Murcia-Negros-Primera-Parada-scaled.jpg" alt="nature class"=center>
    <br>
  <h1>THE LAND</h1>  
    <p>The northern and western parts are largely level plains and gently-rolling slopes. The remaining portion consists of mountain ranges of varied elevations.

      Mt. Canlaon is the highest peak in the Visayas. Other major mountains are Mt. Madalagan and Mt. Silay.
      
      The coastline is more irregular than that of Negros Oriental.
      
      The province has two pronounced seasons, wet and dry.</p>
   <br>
   <br>   
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
  <h1>A BRIEF HISTORY</h1>    
      <p1>The Negros Island was originally called " Buglas", but the Spaniards changed this to Negros because of the dark-skinned Negritos that inhabited the area.
      
      The first capital of the province was Ilog in 1743, and was later transferred to Himamaylan. Bacolod became the province's capital in 1849.
      
      Negros Occidental officially became a province on March 10, 1917.
      
      In 1986, the province was divided into two, with the northern part declared as the province of Negros del Norte. Later that year, however, the Supreme Court declared the creation unconstitutional and eventually made Negros Occidental whole again.</p1>

    <br>
    <h1>THE PEOPLE</h1>
    <p> 
      The people are called Negrenses. Majority speak "Ilonggo" or "Hilligaynon" and the rest, particularly in the areas bordering Negros Oriental, speak "Cebuano".
      
      Residents of Bacolod City, the capital, are called "Bacoleños". </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    <h1>THE COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY</h1>
    <p>Negros Occidental is known for its sugar, making it the country's "sugar bowl". It produces more than half of the country's sugar. Fifteen sugar centrals are located throughout the province.
      
      Other crops, however, are brought in from neighbouring provinces because of the priority given to sugar cane. With the recent plunge in world sugar prices, the province is beginning to grow new crops like coffee, black pepper, ramie, among others.
      
      Fishponds can be found in the city of Cadiz.
      
      One of the biggest copper mines in the country is found in Sipalay town.</p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
    <h2>MODERN-DAY HISTORY</h2>
    <p>Towards the end of 1987, after the successful overthrow of the Marcos regime, the overall economic situation started to show a positive upturn. The campaign for agricultural diversification had been gaining momentum, paving the way for more landowners to invest in prawn and fish farming, seafood catching, raising of livestock and high-value organic produce such as fruits and vegetables, as well as other cash crops. Investments' upswing became apparent by 1988. The participation of the industrial sector accelerated the consumer-led economic growth and development manifested with the increase in sales of consumer goods and by-products. Today, Negros Occidental remains one of the most progressive and largely developed Philippine provinces, in large due to the profits from the sugar industry, but also due to economic diversification in other fields. Due to the vast population of Negros Occidental, it became the province with the most number of cities outside of the National Capital Region.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

   <p>On 29 May 2015, the Negros Island Region was formed when Negros Occidental and its capital was separated from Western Visayas and transferred to the new region along with Negros Oriental, when President Benigno Aquino III signed Executive Order No. 183, s. 2015. But it was abolished on August 9, 2017, when President Rodrigo Duterte revoked Executive Order No. 183, s. 2015 through the signage of Executive Order No. 38, citing the reason of the lack of funds to fully establish the NIR according to Benjamin Diokno, the Secretary of Budget and Management, reverting Negros Occidental and its capital back into Western Visayas. However, with the Philippines' current presidential administration promoting federalism, the idea of the twin provinces of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental reunified into one federal state/region is already in the talks of local provincial politicians, with additional support from the native Negrenses. There is also a suggestion, jointly approved by the provincial governors, that Negros Occidental along with Negros Oriental, be renamed with their pre-colonial names as "Buglas Nakatundan" and "Buglas Sidlakan" respectively, with Negros, as a federal state, be named as "Negrosanon Federated Region", due to the negative racial connotation associated with the name "Negros".</p>
